# ToDo Android Application

Android application developted for the class "Programmierung Mobile Endger√§te".

Made by:
- Ahmad Abo Louha
- Benito Grauel
- Hamza Harti
- Alejandro Restrepo Klinge

## Concept

This app should help users to keep better track of tasks and help them organize them in an optimal way. 

A user may have various categories (School, Freetime, Work ...). For each given category the user may define slots (Category Blocks), in which he wants to invest his/her time in the given category. 

After having created a category, the user may create specific tasks for this category. A task has always a duration (1/2/3... Hours) and a deadline (When should this task be done). There are two types of tasks: Fixed tasks and non-fixed tasks.

- Fixed Tasks: They are connected with a Category Block (Time Slot on a given day) and they are created from a specific Category Block. A task that should be done on a specific date and specific time. A good example of it is an appointment. 
- Non-Fixed Tasks: They only have a deadline and a duration. Our program tries to find the best fitting Category Block for each non-fixed task. A good example of it may be summiting homework. (It doesn't matter when the user does it, but he plans to do it for a given duration and should be done before a given date, when does he do it, is not relevant).

Each time the user wants to see his schedule, the non-fixed tasks would be assigned to the best fitting category block. If the user adds new non-fixed tasks, his/her schedule is going to be updated.

### Example: 

**User A** created the category **University**. **User A** wants to invest some time doing uni stuff on a given date, so he/she creates **Category Block 1** which is going to take place on a given date and defined start and end hours. **Category Block 1** is going to take place on the *30-03-2021* between *11:00* and *14:00*. 

On that day and at that time **User A** is going to be doing some task/s from the category **University**. He/She has to make the finishing touches on a project with the deadline *01-04-2021*. He/she created a new non-fixed task **End-Up-Project Task** with the duration of 2 hours and the deadline *01-04-2021*. This task should be done before its deadline. When exactly is not important.

For the given situation the **End-Up-Project Task** is going to be done on the **Category Block 1**.

**Category Block 1**
| Tasks               |Start Hour| End Hour|
| :-------------------|:--------:| :------:|
| End-Up-Project Task | 11:00    | 13:00   |
| *Unnasign Time*     | 13:00    | 14:00   |

After having created the **Category Block 1** and the **End-Up-Project Task** he/she finds out, that he has an appointment with a Professor on the *30-03-2021* at *11:00* for 1 hour. 

**User 1** creates a fixed task **Fixed-Task 1** on the **Category Block 1** with the duration of 1 hour starting at *11:00*. This implies that the Task **End-Up-Project Task** has to change its starting and end hours. With the current situation **Category Block 1** looks like this:

**Category Block 1**
| Tasks               |Start Hour| End Hour|
| :-------------------|:--------:| :------:|
| Fixed Task 1        | 11:00    | 12:00   |
| End-Up-Project Task | 12:00    | 14:00   |

**User 1** decides to do another Category Block ( **Category Block 2** ) for the category **University** on the *25-03-2021* between *14:00* and *16:00*. The schedule is going to be updated and it would look something like this:

**Category Block 2** (25-03-2021)
| Tasks               |Start Hour| End Hour|
| :-------------------|:--------:| :------:|
| End-Up-Project Task | 14:00    | 16:00   |


**Category Block 1** (30-03-2021)
| Tasks               |Start Hour| End Hour|
| :-------------------|:--------:| :------:|
| Fixed Task 1        | 11:00    | 12:00   |
| *Unnasign Time*     | 12:00    | 14:00   |



## How did we work

We divided our team into two parts: Frontend and Backend.

- Front-End: Hamza + Benito.
- Back-End: Ahmad + Alejandro.

Meetings once or twice a week to discuss and explain finished tasks and
to split new tasks.

# Front-Documentation
the Front-End is divided into three majors parts, in the one hand the first one contains all the activities needed to perform the differents requirements of our App, in the other hand the second part represent the UI. The third part takes care of all the ressources from Layouts to Drawables and more. 


## Part-One: Activities
our activities can subdivised into 3 different division, each division treats a major requirement. For instance the BlockCategoryActivity is responsible for everything concerning a Block of a Category.


![Activities](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/638a3fc4a09bd8fb4558007cd5c8c8b52fdb045b/doku/Bilder_Readme/Activities.JPG)
### BlockCategoryActivity
the activities in this sub-category allows the user to create and edit category blocks.

 - Activity to add a new Category Block, which calls the layout activity_new_block_category

```java
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {  
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);  
  setContentView(R.layout.activity_new_block_category);  
  newBlockActivityViewModel = new ViewModelProvider(this).get(NewBlockActivityViewModel.class);
```
- Activity to edit a Category Block, which calls for the same layout but change it parameters to suit our needs 
```java
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {  
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);  
  setContentView(R.layout.activity_new_block_category);  
  newBlockActivityViewModel = new ViewModelProvider(this).get(NewBlockActivityViewModel.class);
```
- the view model for this Activity contains all the functions used to either update or save a category Block
```java
public void saveBlock(CategoryBlock categoryBlock) {  
    this.tasksPackageRepository.insertCategoryBlock(categoryBlock);  
}
```
```java
public void updateBlock(long categoryBlockID, CategoryBlock newCategoryBlock) throws FixedTaskException, ObjectNotFoundException {  
    this.tasksPackageRepository.updateCategoryBlock(categoryBlockID, newCategoryBlock);  
}
```
### CategoryActivity
the activities in this sub-category allows the user to create and edit categories.

 - Activity to add a new Category, which calls the layout activity_new_category

```java
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {  
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);  
  setContentView(R.layout.activity_new_category);  
  newCategoryActivityViewModel = new ViewModelProvider(this).get(NewCategoryActivityViewModel.class);
```
- Activity to edit a Category, which calls for the same layout but change it parameters to suit our needs 
```java
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {  
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);  
  setContentView(R.layout.activity_new_category);  
  newCategoryActivityViewModel = new ViewModelProvider(this).get(NewCategoryActivityViewModel.class);
```
- the view model for this Activity contains all the functions used to either update or save a category
```java
public void saveCategory (Category category)  
{  
   this.tasksPackageRepository.insertCategory(category);  
}
```
```java
public void updateCategory (long categoryID, String newCatName, String newCatColor, String newCatLetterColor) throws ObjectNotFoundException {  
    this.tasksPackageRepository.updateCategory(categoryID, newCatName, newCatColor, newCatLetterColor);  
}
```
### TaskActivity
the activities in this sub-category allows the user to create and edit tasks.

 - Activity to add a new Task, which calls the layout activity_new_task

```java
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {  
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);  
  setContentView(R.layout.activity_new_category);  
  newCategoryActivityViewModel = new ViewModelProvider(this).get(NewCategoryActivityViewModel.class);
```
- Activity to edit a Task, which calls for the same layout but change it parameters to suit our needs 
```java
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {  
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);  
  setContentView(R.layout.activity_new_task);  
  newTaskActivityViewModel = new ViewModelProvider(this).get(NewTaskActivityViewModel.class);
```
- the view model for this Activity contains all the functions used to either update or save a task
```java
public void saveTasks (Task task) {  
    this.tasksPackageRepository.insertTask(task);  
}
```
```java
 public void updateTask (long taskID, String newName, String newDescription, int newDuration, LocalDate deadline) throws ObjectNotFoundException, TaskFixException, TimeException {  
    this.tasksPackageRepository.updateTask(taskID, newName, newDescription, newDuration, deadline);  
}
```
### Other Activities
we have other activities that are as important, for instance the **loginActivity** that allows the user to connect to the App. Moreover we have the **MainActivity** which starts right after the **SplashActivity** 

## Part-Two : UI
The UI has four important Fragements : **Block, Category, Home, Settings**

![UI](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/638a3fc4a09bd8fb4558007cd5c8c8b52fdb045b/doku/Bilder_Readme/UI.JPG)

### Home:
- Display the users Category-Blocks and the associated tasks with the day, month and year
- Select any Given Date
- Option to add a Task

### Blocks:
- Display the users Category-Blocks.
- Add a Block from your given Categories with a name, date, start and finish time
- with a long click show the options to either delete or update a Block

### Categories :
- Display the users Categories.
- Add a Category
- With a long click show the options to either delete or update a Category


## Part-Three : Ressources
all the Drawables , Layouts, ... are avaibles in the resources and in order to have a clear vision a better highlight the connection between the various Layouts, and how each resource is used in the App we present the following Simple Use-Case.
### First Step: Login
![login](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/638a3fc4a09bd8fb4558007cd5c8c8b52fdb045b/doku/Bilder_Readme/LoginScreen.JPG)

### Second Step: Add a Category
- from the main screen, where we don't have any event yet, navigate to Categories : drawer -> Categories (Menu)

![HomeScreenEmoty](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/144a33e373f4d77b0213bed9b633bbd0c52f7e39/doku/Bilder_Readme/homescreenempty.jpg)
- in this Activity you can add a Category by giving it a name and selecting a color.

![addcat](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/d1bc39895bf9000e2e60040fba94a5eeb3a03071/doku/Bilder_Readme/addcat.jpg)
![catcolor](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/d1bc39895bf9000e2e60040fba94a5eeb3a03071/doku/Bilder_Readme/coloraddcat.jpg)
![fullcat](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/d1bc39895bf9000e2e60040fba94a5eeb3a03071/doku/Bilder_Readme/addcatfullname.jpg)

- you can finally see that in this screen that the Category has been successfully added.

![catfragment](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/d1bc39895bf9000e2e60040fba94a5eeb3a03071/doku/Bilder_Readme/fragmentcat.jpg)
### Third Step: Add a Block
- from the main screen navigate to Blocks : drawer -> Blocks (Menu) and Click on Add Block
- in this Activity we can add a new Block by giving the following parameters : Date, Start, Finish and specify to which Category this Block belongs

![blockadd](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/1ff6a1b226de019a85dd168f7db88d12360d62c0/doku/Bilder_Readme/addblock.jpg)
![blockadd](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/1ff6a1b226de019a85dd168f7db88d12360d62c0/doku/Bilder_Readme/addblockdate.jpg)
![blockadd](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/1ff6a1b226de019a85dd168f7db88d12360d62c0/doku/Bilder_Readme/addblocktime.jpg)
![blockadd](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/1ff6a1b226de019a85dd168f7db88d12360d62c0/doku/Bilder_Readme/addblockfull.jpg)
- here we can see the block has been successfully added

![blockfragment](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/1ff6a1b226de019a85dd168f7db88d12360d62c0/doku/Bilder_Readme/fragmentblock.jpg)
### Fourth Step: Add a Task

- now that we have a block we can see in the home page that block is already there but we still have no tasks. to do that we click on the blue plus button.

![task](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/362a9401a4875ed04c1357830e7d50aa160740d6/doku/Bilder_Readme/blocknotask.jpg)
- in this Activity you can add a task by giving various parameters about it

![task](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/362a9401a4875ed04c1357830e7d50aa160740d6/doku/Bilder_Readme/addtask.jpg)
![task](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/362a9401a4875ed04c1357830e7d50aa160740d6/doku/Bilder_Readme/addtaskfull.jpg)

- as you can see the task is already present in our block

![task](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/362a9401a4875ed04c1357830e7d50aa160740d6/doku/Bilder_Readme/taskhome.jpg)

> If you have more than one Task, a long click on the block will show the rest. another click will hide them again

![task](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/362a9401a4875ed04c1357830e7d50aa160740d6/doku/Bilder_Readme/taskplus.jpg)

## Back End Documentation

### Main Application

Application Class, Inherits from `android.app.Application`. In this
[Class](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/pme/mpe/core/MainApplication.java)
the Key Value Store checks whether a user is already logged in or if this
is the first time the app is being used. Based on the result, the user
is forwarded either to the login page or the main page of the app.

### Model

Contains the models classes for the application

#### Tasks Package

##### Category

Has the information about a Category (name, ID, color ...) as well as a
list of the CategoryBlocks and a list of Tasks which belong to the Category.
It works as the main control point for adding new Category Block and Tasks and
modifying existing ones. Because a Category knows all the Category Blocks and
Tasks that belong to itself, it was the better place to store this logic.

##### Category-Block

Has the information about a Category Block (name, ID, color ...) as well
as a two lists of tasks and a reference to the associated category. One of
the List takes care of the `Fixed Tasks` and the other takes care of the
`Non-Fixed Tasks`. The difference between the two kinds of tasks is going
to be explained in the paragraph next to this one. This difference is
important at this level because some Tasks change their Category Block
dynamically (Non Fixed Tasks) and the Category Block needs to keep track
of which Tasks may changed and which stay on the same place.

##### Task

Has the information about a Task (name, description, duration, deadline)
as well as a reference to a Category (To which it belongs). A task may be
Fixed or Non-Fixed or even change its behaviour on the Runtime.
* Fixed Task have a Category Block to which they are "Married", that means
that the Task must be done on a given Category Block.
* Non Fixed Task on the other part just need to be done before a Deadline,
the function `Category.autoAssignTasks()` finds the best fitting Category
Block for a Non-Fixed-Task and "Connect" them for the Front End to show them
together.

#### User Package

##### User

Has the information about a User (name, first name, email ...) as well
as a List of the Categories created by a User.

#### Relations

The relationship between the model components is defined in this
package, e.g. CategoryBlockHaveTasks.

##### CategoryBlockHaveTasks

This class contains a reference to the parent class "CategoryBlock"
represented by ID and a list of tasks belonging to the ID. It is also
checks whether the tasks in the list are fixed or soft fixed tasks,
then the tasks are added to the associated attribute list, e.g. if the
Task fix is:

```java
this.categoryBlock.addTaskToFixedTasks (tasks.get (i));
```

##### CategoryWithCatBlockAndTasksRelation

This class contains a reference to the parent class "Category"
represented by ID, it has also a list of CategoryBlocks and a list of
tasks belonging to the Category.

```java
public class CategoryWithCatBlocksAndTasksRelation {
    @Embedded
    public Category category;

    @Relation(
            parentColumn = "categoryId",
            entityColumn = "CB_CategoryId"
    )
    public List<CategoryBlock> categoryBlocks;

    @Relation(
            parentColumn = "categoryId",
            entityColumn = "T_categoryID"
    )
    public List<Task> tasks;

    public Category merge()
    {
        this.category.setCategoryBlockList(this.categoryBlocks);
        this.category.setTaskList(this.tasks);

        return this.category;
    }
}
```

##### UserCategoryRelation

This class contains a reference to the parent class "User" represented
by userId, and a list of Category represented the child class belonging
to the Category.

#### Util

Helper classes like PasswordHashing, TimerPickerDialogBlock...

### Storage

#### DAOs

Data Access Objects, which used to define the database interactions.

##### [TaskPackageDao](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/pme/mpe/storage/dao/TasksPackageDao.java)

Has the required queries to enable access to Tasks, CategoryBlocks and
Categories

```java
 @Insert
    long insertCategory(Category category);
 
 //Live Data Queries
 @Transaction
 @Query("SELECT * FROM Category")
    LiveData<List<CategoryWithCatBlocksAndTasksRelation>> getCategoriesWithCategoryBlocks();
```

##### [UserDao](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/pme/mpe/storage/dao/UserDao.java)

Required queries to enable access to the User's information

```java
 @Query("SELECT securePassword FROM User WHERE email LIKE :email")
    String getSecuredPasswordWithEMail(String email);
```

#### [Database](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/tree/main/app/src/main/java/com/pme/mpe/storage/database)

Defines the database configuration and serves as the app's main access
point to the persisted data

#### [Repository](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/tree/main/app/src/main/java/com/pme/mpe/storage/repository)

Has the logic required to access data sources stored in Database

#### [Key¬†Value¬†Store](https://github.com/Fachhochschule-Erfurt-BA5/PME/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/pme/mpe/storage/KeyValueStore.java)

Saves the information about registered users, the class has
methods for writing and reading the user data in / from KVS. When the
app is opened, it is checked whether the user is using the app for the
first time, and then a decision is made as to whether the user is
redirected to the login page or to the home page. In the first case, the
username and id are saved in KVS and he does not have to log in again.
